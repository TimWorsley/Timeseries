The data handled by this website is classified as category 5, "Already in the public domain".  
The sole exception to that is the Quandl API key, for which an Incident Response Plan has
been generated for its loss to attackers.  Architectural considerations were also suggested to
protect this key.

Architectural considerations
To protect the API key, it must not be sent to the client.  That means that our back-end must
handle all data requests to Quandl.  While it was possible to build an asynchronous data
queue for Quandl data, it was decided that the projected load estimate for this website 
allowed a simpler Synchronous design.  Should web traffic exceed expectations, a second phase
development of a back-end asynchronous data queue with server to client notifications would
have to be funded.

Incident Response Plan
1) Disable all web hosts running the website, so that the attacker cannot use them to launch
attacks against us with our own hardware
2) Contact Quandl at https://help.quandl.com/contact and alert them of the loss of the key, and
request a new key
3) Modify ./config/quandl.js with the new API key
4) Patch the vulnerability used by the attackers
5) Re-deploy

Future considerations
Should funding be found for our remote key server project, and that project complete, the
Quandl API key should be moved to that server.
